#   Please have a look at the output of this API:

 

curl 'https://latency-dsn.algolia.net/1/indexes/*/queries?x-algolia-api-key=6be0576ff61c053d5f9a3225e2a90f76&x-algolia-application-id=latency' --data '{"requests":[{"indexName":"ikea","params":"query=cheese&hitsPerPage=16"}]}'

 

It returns a list of products based on the query parameter (cheese in this example). In results.hits you get a list of products.

 

Please create the following JavaScript application:

 

* On the top we have a text input field which takes the query param.

* Below that we display a list or grid of products with their image and name

* When I type in the search field, the following should happen

* After there is a change in the field, wait for 200ms

* If there is another change in that timeframe, reset the time counter and start it again

* If there are no more changes in the timeframe, fire off an Ajax call to load the data (with the text from the field as query param)

* If the input changes again during the runtime of the Ajax call, cancel it. Go to step 1 (i.e. Wait for 200ms etc)

 

I am totally fine with unstyled html. You may use whatever library you wish. Structure your code in a way that it is easy to follow.

 

Use chrome devtools to simulate slow browsers as the API is quite fast.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
